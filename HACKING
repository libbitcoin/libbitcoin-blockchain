Code maintenance tasks:

===============================
Hashtable bucket sizes
===============================

Bucket values in:
  src/database/history_database.cpp
  src/database/spend_database.cpp
are preset based on hashtable load factor calculated from the blockchain.
Run the tools history_db and spend_db 'statinfo' commands to see the
load factor based on the number of rows.

history_database load factor:

  $ cd blockchain/
  $ history_db statinfo history_lookup history_rows

  a = Buckets / Unique addresses

spend_database load factor:

  $ cd blockchain/
  $ spend_db statinfo spends

  a = Buckets / Total rows

The transaction_database should also be updated:
  src/database/transaction_database.cpp
But there is no tool to see the total number of txs due to how the
database is implemented. However this number can be found on the internet.

===============================
Checkpoints
===============================

Make sure to update the files include/bitcoin/blockchain/checkpoints.hpp
and src/checkpoints.hpp on a regular basis.
